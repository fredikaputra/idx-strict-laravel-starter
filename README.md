# IDX Strict Laravel Starter

A strict, standardized template for bootstrapping a new Laravel application. This repository combines the **ultra-strict, type-safe architecture** of the [nunomaduro/laravel-starter-kit](https://github.com/nunomaduro/laravel-starter-kit) with the streamlined development experience of **Firebase Studio**, leveraging **Nix** for a fully reproducible and dependency-free environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Since this repository is built to run seamlessly within Firebase Studio, the setup process is simplified.

### 1. Open in Firebase Studio

### 2. Complete Initial Setup

Once the workspace is loaded in Firebase Studio, you must run the following commands in the terminal to ensure file permissions are correct and the database is initialized:

```sh
# Enter the Sail environment shell
sail root-shell
```

```sh
# Fix file permissions for storage directory
chown -R sail storage

# Run migrations to set up the database
php artisan migrate
```

## ⚠️ Important Permissions Note

After running the setup commands, you may not be able to edit files inside the `storage` directory directly in the editor due to the permission changes (`chown -R sail storage`).

If you need to modify any files within the `storage` folder, you must do so by first entering the Docker container shell using `sail shell`.
