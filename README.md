## 🛠️ Network Configuration (Crucial)
To ensure the environment functions correctly, you must adjust the port visibility in the **Backend Ports** tab:

1. **Vite Development Server**

- Port: `5173`
- Visibility: Change from Private to Public.
- Reason: Allows your browser to load hot-reloaded assets and CSS.

2. **Laravel Development Server**

- Port: `9000`
- Visibility: Change from Private to Public.
- Reason: The headless browser runner requires a public tunnel to access the application. If this is set to private, tests will fail.

## 🧪 Browser Testing (Pest)

If you want to run browser-based tests, there are two important requirements for the IDX environment:

1. **Virtual Display:** Because the environment is headless, you must prepend your test commands with `xvfb-run` (e.g., `xvfb-run php artisan test`).
2. **Asset Preparation:** Ensure your assets are already built (`bun run build`) and use those static builds instead of running `bun run dev`.

### ⚡ The Shortcut (Recommended)
To make testing comfortable and easy to run, a custom alias has been configured. You can execute everything described above by simply running:

```bash
test
```

> This alias is stored in `~/.bash_aliases`.
